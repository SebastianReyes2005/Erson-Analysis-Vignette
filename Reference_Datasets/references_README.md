## Reference Data Sources

The **neuroendocrine reference datasets** were obtained from the paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19012-4).
The corresponding GEO repository may be found at this [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142653), with the files *GSE142653_pit_dev_CellInfo.csv.gz* and *GSE142653_pit_dev_5181_count.csv.gz* corresponding to the *NeuroMeta.csv.gz* and *NeuroExpression.csv.gz* files, respectively.

The **immune cell reference dataset** was obtained from the paper [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl5197).
The data was not uploaded to GEO, but can instead be found in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI, [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/ArrayExpress/studies/E-MTAB-11536?query=E-MTAB-11536).
