# Erson Analysis Vignette
This is a short explanatory vignette I created outlining the workflow I created for the project I began for the [Erson Lab](https://ersonlab.org/our-team/) during Summer 2024, when I conducted research with them. The information is similar in its scope to this [vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial) developed by the Satija Lab over at the New York Genome Center, but has been modified to better suit the needs of the Erson Lab.

The example dataset used can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM6337431).
