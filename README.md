# Erson-Analysis
This is a short explanatory vignette I created outlining the workflow I created for the project I began for the [Erson Lab](https://ersonlab.org/our-team/) during Summer 2024, when I conducted research with them. The information is similar in its scope to this [vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial) developed by the Satija Lab over at the New York Genome Center, but has been modified to better suit the needs of the Erson Lab.
